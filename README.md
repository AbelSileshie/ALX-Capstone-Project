# ALX Capstone Project

This repository contains the code for the ALX Capstone Project, which is a web-based movie recommendation application. It allows users to view and search for movies, add them to their favorite list, and explore more information about movies through the TMDB (The Movie Database) API. The application also supports user authentication and uses Supabase as the backend for storing user information and authentication management.

## ðŸ’» Technologies

This project is built with the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
- **Zustand**: A small, fast state management library for React.
- **Supabase**: An open-source Firebase alternative to handle authentication and the backend database.
- **TMDB API**: The Movie Database API used to fetch movie data for display.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides a great development experience.
